### What I learned

AS simple as it might seem I learned something new, using picture tag to display two images in a responsive site. 

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<picture class="image">
      <source srcset="./images/image-product-desktop.jpg" media="(min-width: 48em)">
      <img src="./images/image-product-mobile.jpg" alt="Gabrielle Essence Eau De Parfum bottle" class="product-img">
</picture>
```
